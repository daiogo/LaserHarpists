# What is a laser harp?
A laser harp is a harp that has laser beams emulating the strings of a regular harp. Whenever you intercept a laser beam, a note is played to that correspondent intercepted beam.

# Cool features in our laser harp
- The notes are played by an Android app;
- It's wireless! It communicates with the app via Bluetooth;
- There are ultrasonic range finders that measure the height of your interception;
  - That makes it possible to play 3 notes in a single laser beam.
- There are two modes of operation:
  - Free Play: let your inner Jean Michel Jarre shine (:
  - Learn To Play: learn to play a song in the harp
- RGB LED strips positioned in the front of each laser beam
  - They lit to the note you play when you intercept a laser beam on Free Play mode
  - They lit to the correspondent string and height to be intercepted in the current music

# Pics or it didn't happen
Yes, there's a demo video! Too bad we didn't had the time to learn how to play the harp (:
